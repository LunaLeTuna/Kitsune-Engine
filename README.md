Basicly made this to help me quickly build aplications and games, mainly for a computer information sience class i'm taking in highschool.
It has very messy V8 implementation. :3
Also, to quickly get it up I kinda barrowed some code from learnopengl.

to test out the demos, if you can even call them that, change the diffirent js files to "index"
Also the current compiled version in the repository is compiled for linux, oof...

Another problem is that some computers may not load all the props, bigger oof
